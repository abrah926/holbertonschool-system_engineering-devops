# Scale-Up Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview
This document outlines the scale-up design for the web infrastructure of **www.foobar.com**, ensuring high availability, load distribution, and component separation for improved performance and fault tolerance.

## Infrastructure Components
1. **2 Load Balancers (HAProxy Cluster):**
   - Configured in an Active-Passive setup to ensure high availability.

2. **3 Web Servers (Nginx):**
   - Handle static content and forward dynamic requests to application servers.

3. **3 Application Servers:**
   - Execute the business logic and process dynamic content.

4. **2 Database Servers:**
   - Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) setup for data redundancy and failover.

5. **3 Firewalls:**
   - Protect the infrastructure at each layer: user-to-load balancer, load balancer-to-web servers, and web servers-to-database.

6. **SSL Certificates:**
   - Ensure secure HTTPS communication between users and servers.

7. **Monitoring Clients:**
   - Tools like Prometheus or Sumologic to collect system metrics and logs.

## How Each Component Works
1. **Load Balancer Cluster:**
   - **Active-Passive Setup:** One HAProxy node actively handles traffic, while the other remains on standby. If the active node fails, the passive one takes over seamlessly.
   - **Round-Robin Algorithm:** Distributes incoming traffic evenly across web servers.

2. **Web Servers:**
   - Serve static files (images, HTML, CSS) and act as reverse proxies for dynamic requests.

3. **Application Servers:**
   - Run the website's backend code and communicate with the database.

4. **Database Cluster:**
   - **Primary Node:** Handles all write operations.
   - **Replica Node:** Syncs with the primary and handles read operations, improving performance.

5. **Firewalls:**
   - Restrict access based on predefined rules, preventing unauthorized traffic.

6. **SSL Certificates:**
   - Encrypt data in transit, protecting user information.

7. **Monitoring:**
   - Collects metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and QPS (Queries Per Second).

## Benefits of This Design
1. **High Availability:**
   - Redundant load balancers and servers prevent service disruptions.

2. **Improved Performance:**
   - Traffic distribution and component separation enhance responsiveness.

3. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - If one server fails, others continue handling requests.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Easily add more web, application, or database servers as traffic grows.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
   - Redundant load balancers and database replicas prevent system-wide outages.

2. **Security:**
   - Firewalls, HTTPS, and access controls protect infrastructure components.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Real-time tracking ensures quick issue detection and resolution.

This design ensures a scalable, resilient, and secure web infrastructure for **www.foobar.com**, ready to handle increased traffic and operational demands efficiently.
