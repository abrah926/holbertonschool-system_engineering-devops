    A server is a computer or virtual machine connects other devices or computers to each other so they can share lets say information or resources. For example, file sharing.

    What is the role of the domain name

    Well, it would be too hard to remember a bunch of numbers like an ip address and now with ipv6 is even harder so we use names like example.com and the domain name maps it to the proper ip address

    What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com

    Idk you tell me lol! could be A could be CNAME, probably CNAME so you dont have to manually input any changes

    What is the role of the web server

    Handles http requests and fwds dynamic requests to the app server

    What is the role of the application server

    Runs my application file (app.py) handles the requests from the web server, we connect to the db from here too

    What is the role of the database

    Stores data like user pw, email, so on or my app setting or data you like to store pretty much

    What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website

    Http requests


    SPOF (single point of failure)

    Easy, if you only have one of smt and that smt fails is over, same reason why we all carry a spare tire in our vehicles

    Downtime when maintenance is needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)

    Any type of maintenance could disrupt the service, can be fixed by doing so in a stage env then uploading changes or creating redundancy like having multiple servers and update one while the others provide service along other forms to make this work

    Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

    Seems like you need a load balancer, but could also scale vertically or horizontally. Even better why not all 3. there is many ways to solve the issue
