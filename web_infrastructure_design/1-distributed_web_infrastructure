You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

    For every additional element, why you are adding it

    HA addded to distribute incoming traffic between multiple backend servers, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed, this redundancy helps maintain the service functionality across all 3 servers counting the sever we already had + the 2 that were added. Also, added a 2nd db server (replica) if I had to explain why added the replica that would defeat the purpose of me wanting to add it in the first place I would think

    What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works

    round-robin: it distributes the traffic across all servers in the same quantities so no single server gets overloaded. leastconn is the recommended, will probably implement it in th

    Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both

    Active-Active: the difference is that the active-passive has to wait for one server to fail before the other takes over, this isnt optimal as only one server handles all the traffic

    How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
    What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application

    Well primary or master db performs read and write operations, while the slave can only read, idally you want multiple of each to avoid spof

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

    Where are SPOF

    if the load balancer fails it will cause a spof same with the master db

    Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)

    Having no HTTPS means everyone can peek inside providing access to unwanted or malicious users and no firewall will enable them the access needed to do so

    No monitoring

    Without monitoring tools, there’s no way to track the system’s health, detect failures, or analyze performance metrics, is like trying to run a business without monitoring sales, payroll, expenses, etc
